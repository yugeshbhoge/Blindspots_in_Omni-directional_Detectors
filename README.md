# Blindspots_in_Omni-directional_Detectors
Investigated the directional sensitivity and blind spots of gravitational wave detectors **(LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA)** using **PyCBC**, developing mathematical models for antenna patterns and exploring mitigation strategies through multi-detector networks to improve detection sensitivity.
